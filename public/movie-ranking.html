    <h2>My top 3 movies</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>The Place Beyond the Pines</h3>
    <p>
      This is my favorite movie of all time. It has a lot of emotions being
      carried in.

    <h3>The Greatest Showman</h3>
    <p>
      Some says maybe it is cringe or what so ever. But still I like it because
      it has Zendaya LOL.
    </p>
    <h3>Interstellar</h3>
    <p>
      Boom! What a perfect movie. From the soundtrack and the acting, all of it
      is complete. Maybe a bit slow but still I love it.
